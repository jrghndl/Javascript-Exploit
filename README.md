# Javascript Exploit
A method for exploiting vulnerabilities in JavaScript code that allows the user to modify obfuscated anonymous self-invoking Javascript functions.

All of the code used here is working as of Google Chrome Version 88.0.4324.150.
## Description
In an attempt to secure client side Javascript code, developers often use obfuscated anonymous self-invoking functions. These functions are not accessible, the result of which is that it hides its contents from other Javascript code. 

Example:

    (function () {
        let x = "Hello World!"
    }());
Outside of the function, you cannot access the variable x. Paired with obfuscation, this makes it difficult for an outside actor to manipulate a protected client code. However, this is not the case.

While it's true that you cannot directly access anonymous functions, there is a way to get around this limitation. Its more than likely that such code will call a native function at some point. You can get an idea of what native functions are being called by reading the obfuscated code.

Once you have found the target native function, replace the native prototype with a custom prototype. This will be your entry point into the anonymous function. At the end of the modified prototype, you call the old prototype and have it return whatever it normally would so that the modification doesn't cause errors or break the code. In the modified prototype, you can use the following to get information about the target function:

    arguments.callee.caller.arguments
    arguments.callee.caller.name
    arguments.callee.caller.prototype
    arguments.callee.caller.toString()

There may be multiple functions that call the same native function, so in order to figure out which does what, you'll need to piece it together by reading the obfuscated code and through the arguments being passed. 

If you use obfuscated anonymous self-invoking functions to protect your code, then it is vulnerable to attack.
